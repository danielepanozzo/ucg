## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to the field of Computer Graphics. We will cover the basic mathematical concepts, such as 2D and 3D transformations, study the interaction of light with geometry to derive  shading models, and implement rendering algorithms such as ray tracing and rasterization. We will investigate how these fundamental components are integrated in current graphics processors and study the corresponding programming APIs. This course will also include a brief introduction to C++.

Students will experiment with modern graphics programming and build small demos in C++ and OpenGL.

By the end of the course, the student must be able to:

* Explain and apply the fundamental mathematical concepts used in  image synthesis algorithms
* Implement a basic rendering system based on ray tracing
* Implement a basic rendering pipeline based on rasterization
* Develop simple graphics programs in C++ using OpenGL and GLSL
